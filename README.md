### 2023-11 Conclusion
Sadly, it's just not possible to get everything configured to completely replace a Java IDE. Maybe 10 years from now, but not yet.

I've taken the out-of-the-box correctness of other IDEs for granted until now.

By all means give it another try when you have the motivation to, but you're going to run into unsolvable issues.
